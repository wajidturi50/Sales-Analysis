    <h1>Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks</h1>
    <p>Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.</p>
    <h2>Data Cleaning Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Drop NaN values from DataFrame</li>
        <li>Removing rows based on a condition</li>
        <li>Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Exploration</h2>
    <p>Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move to the data exploration section. In this section, we explore 5 high-level business questions related to our data:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?</li>
        <li>What city sold the most product?</li>
        <li>What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying the product?</li>
        <li>What products are most often sold together?</li>
        <li>What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To answer these questions, we walk through many different Pandas and Matplotlib methods. They include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Concatenating multiple CSVs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)</li>
        <li>Adding columns</li>
        <li>Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)</li>
        <li>Using the .apply() method</li>
        <li>Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis</li>
        <li>Plotting bar charts and line graphs to visualize our results</li>
        <li>Labeling our graphs</li>
    </ul>
